# Project Description

## Purpose

- The purpose of this project is to create the resource about COVID-19 vaccination inequity around the world

## Other Research Done In This Area

- https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html
  - This research has been done by _New York Times_, showing vaccination rates over the countries and continents. We see that _Seychelles_ has the highest vaccination rate by 124 doses per 100 people, and _Cameroon_ has the lowest vaccination rate by less than 0.1 dose per 100 people. In continent context, _North America_ has the highest vaccination rate by 45 doses per 100 people, while _Africa_ has the lowest vaccination rate by 1.3 doses per 100 people

  - This paper explores the health and social inequities related to COVID-19 and proposes ethically just interventions. The paper uses an Equity Matrix that can help countries allocate COVID-19 vaccination resources. It also urges countries and policy makers to use similar tools to direct interventions and programs that can help reduce the health disparities

## Datasets

- https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations#source-information-country-by-country
  - Data was collected Data was collected from _Johns Hopkins University (JHU)_ and the JHU dataset is maintained by a team at its _Center for Science and Engineering (CSSE)_
  - The Data set can be accessed from [GitHub](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)

- https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
  - The data for the vaccinations were collected by the _Our World in Data_ team from official reports
  - Data set can be accessed from [GitHub](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)

## Target Audience

- Our target audience is the general public with a focus on people in the **United States**. We also think that it is important to focus on **government officials**.

## Learning Outcomes
